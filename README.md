## Melanoma Dataset Analysis
This repository contains the analysis of a dataset comprising measurements taken on patients with malignant melanoma who underwent surgery at the Department of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark, between 1962 and 1977. The dataset includes key prognostic variables such as tumor thickness, ulceration status, survival time, and patient demographics.

### Analysis Overview
The analysis aims to:

1. Explore the dataset to understand its structure and key variables.
2. Investigate the relationships between various factors and patient outcomes, particularly survival rates.
3. Conduct statistical tests, including log-rank tests and hypothesis testing, to assess the significance of differences in survival between groups.
4. Provide insights and recommendations based on the findings to improve clinical practice and patient care.
### Contents
**Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distributions of variables.
**Data Visualization**: Visualize the relationships between variables using plots such as histograms, bar plots, and survival curves.
**Survival Analysis**: Conduct survival analysis, including Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests, to assess the impact of factors like gender, ulceration status, and skin thickness on survival outcomes.
**Hypothesis Testing**: Perform hypothesis tests to evaluate the significance of differences in survival between groups based on gender, ulceration status, and other factors.
**Conclusion and Recommendations**: Summarizes the findings of the analysis and provide recommendations for clinical practice and further research.
